Summary\n\nBellabeat is a company that produces health-focused products for women with a goal of growing in the smart device market. Bellabeat creates wearable technology for women that monitors health data such as activity, sleep, stress, menstrual cycle, and mindfulness habits. This technology connects to an app that allows users to track and view data on their wellness activity to understand their habits and make informed decisions relate to their health.\n\nThe goal of this case study is to gain insights on smart device use, gained from FitBit Fitness Tracker Data posted on Kaggle by MÖBIUS:\n\n<https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit?sort=recent-comments&page=2>\n\nand apply these insights to Bellabeat's own customers that can be applied to Bellabeat's marketing strategy.\n\n# 2. Ask Phase\n\nFor this case study, I will be considering Bellabeat's Leaf, a wellness tracker that can be worn as a bracelet, necklace, or clip and connects to the company's app to track activity, sleep, and stress. I will utilize the smart fitness data gained from FitBit users to gain insights and provide recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing strategy based around the following questions:\n\n1.  What are some trends in smart device usage?\n\n2.  How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n\n3.  How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n# 3. Prepare Phase\n\n### 3.1 Data Background\n\nThe data for this case study was generated from a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between the dates of 3/12/2016 and 5/12/2016. It contains records from 30 FitBit users who consented to submitting their personal tracker data. The dataset posted on Kaggle by MÖBIUS contained the following CSV files:\n\n| Table Name                    | Description                                                                                                                                                   |\n|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| daiyActivity_merged           | Daily activity from 33 users over a period of 31 days, which includes daily steps, distance, intensities, and calories                                        |\n| dailyCalories_merged          | The daily calories burned by each of the users over 31 days                                                                                                   |\n| dailyIntensities_merged       | Daily intensities of each user measured in both minutes and distance and divided into categories of sedentary, lightly active, fairly active, and very active |\n| dailySteps_merged             | The steps taken each day by each user                                                                                                                         |\n| Heart rate_seconds_merged     | Heart rate logs by 7 of the users                                                                                                                             |\n| hourlyCalories_merged         | Calories burned by hour of each of the users                                                                                                                  |\n| hourlyIntensities_merged      | Hourly total and intensities averaged by each user                                                                                                            |\n| hourlySteps_merged            | The steps taken by each user measured hourly                                                                                                                  |\n| minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged   | Calories burned by each user measured by minutes and in a narrow format                                                                                       |\n| minuteCaloriesWide_merged     | Calories burned by each user measured by minutes and in a wide format                                                                                         |\n| minuteIntenstiesNarrow_merged | Intensities of each user by the minute in a narrow format                                                                                                     |\n| minuteIntenstiesWide_merged   | Intensities of each user by the minute in a wide format                                                                                                       |\n| minuteMETsNarrow_merged       | A ratio of the energy spent during physical activity compared to energy spent at a resting phase measured by minutes                                          |\n| minuteSleep_merged            | Sleep time in minutes of 24 of the users                                                                                                                      |\n| MinuteStepsNarrow_merged      | Steps taken by each user measured by minutes and in a narrow format                                                                                           |\n| MinuteStepsWide_merged        | Steps taken by each user measured by minutes and in a wide format                                                                                             |\n| sleepDay_merged               | Tracked sleep every day of each of the user measured by total sleeps per day, minutes asleep, and total time in bed                                           |\n| weightLogInfo_merged          | Weight of 8 users track by day in Kg and pounds                                                                                                               |\n\nFor my analysis, I decided to take a dive into the daily data to see how users of wearable health technology are using their devices each day. I narrowed down my analysis to focus on 5 of the tables which included:\n\n-   dailyActivity_merged\n\n-   dailyCalories_merged\n\n-   dailyIntensities_merged\n\n-   dailySteps_merged\n\n-   sleepDay_merged\n\nOut of these tables, I removed dailySteps_merged, dailyIntensities_merged and dailyCalories_merged as the data from both could be found in the dailyActivity_merged file.\n\n### 3.2 Data Limitations:\n\n-   Small Sample Size\n\n    -   We cannot be sure that this dataset is representative of the population as a whole due to its small sample size of only 33 users. Because of this, it is important to remember that the results may be biased due to small sample size and short time frame of data collection.\n\n-   Missing Demographics\n\n    -   The sample data did not include information on demographics such as age, gender, and location. Since Bellabeat's target audience is largely centered upon women, data with gender information for participants could potentially lead to more reliable results in this situation to see if there are differences between men and women in smart device use.\n\n-   Missing Data\n\n    -   There are 4 rows in the data that record 0 activity for that day and specific individual, showing that the tracker may not have been worn or maybe wasn't working properly. I chose to delete these records in excel before analyzing the datasets in RStudio as the goal of the business task is to analyze use of the smart device and these are days where the device was not used.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4. Process Phase\n\nI chose R to use as my primary tool for this project due to the large size of the dataset and the wide variety of tools available in R to process, Analyze, and Visualize the data.

Some key points:\n\n-   The majority of participants fall into the \"Fairly Active Lifestyle\"\n\n-   Participants that fell into the \"Fairly Active\" user type, also had a higher average of calories burned daily, over twice the calories burned as the \"Sedentary\" and \"Lightly Active\" categories.\n\n-   On average, the users in this study spent the majority of their day in the \"sedentary intensity\"\n\n-   Daily steps and daily distance were both positively correlated with daily burned calories\n\n-   On average, the participants in this study did not meet the recommended 8 hours of sleep a night, for any day of the week but most of the participants did fall into the high quality sleeper category, meaning they spend 85% or more of their time in bed asleep\n\n-   There did appear to be some clustering of \"Lightly Active\", \"Fairly Active\", and \"Active\" users that got the recommended 480 minutes, or 8 hours, of sleep a night, however, I do not believe the dataset was large enough or that there was enough of a trend in this specific analysis to draw a correlation between sleep and user type.\n\n# 6 Act Phase \n\nConsidering the small sample size and time frame from this dataset, I would recommend further analysis from Bellabeat's own tracking data to eliminate potential bias and increase the reliability of the results. However, based on this dataset alone and the trends found, I would make the following recommendations to Bellabeat:\n\n1.  Most users fall into the \"Fairly Active\" lifestyle, considering this, the use of smart devices to measure health data may have more success being marketed as promoting a healthy and moderately active lifestyle as a whole as opposed to being marketed as a sports tracker for above average activity levels.\n\n2.  As sleep is very important in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and seeing that on average, users in this study did not meet the recommended nightly sleep, Bellabeat may have success in marketing products that could promote healthy sleeping patterns such as:\n\n    -   Wearable devices that are comfortable enough to be worn at night so sleep can regularly be tracked, yet aesthetically pleasing enough for consumers to wear during daily activities.\n\n    -   Devices with long lasting batteries that also charge quickly so consumers can spend more time wearing the product and measuring health data as opposed to having to charge the product more.\n\n3.  Since steps taken had a positive correlation with calories burned and users spent most of their time in the \"Sedentary\" intensity, Bellabeat could market wearable products with reminders to move and be active as the smart device detects users being in the \"Sedentary\" intensity after a certain period of time.","metadata":{}}]}
